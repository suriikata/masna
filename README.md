# Final Projects: Nonparametrics, Bayesian and Multivariate Analysis

This repository contains the final projects from the nonparametrics, Bayesian, and multivariate analysis courses at HSE University. 
Each project is contained in its own folder, with the project report and any associated code or data files.

## Nonparametric Data Analysis

The nonparametrics project is located in the "NPTA" folder. The projects involved applying the following methods:
*  Exploratory data analysis + Kernel optimization
*  Normality analysis
*  NP-Cluster analysis
*  NP-Regression analysis
*  Log-linear modelling

## Bayesian Statistics

The Bayesian projects are located in the "bayesian" folder. The projects focused on applying the following methods:
* Probabilistic programming
* GLM
* Hierarhical models
